# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to use

1. When you make a change that requires a version bump, run:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to select which packages have changed and write a summary.

3. Commit the generated changeset file along with your changes.

4. When the release workflow runs, it will:
   - Create a PR to version packages if there are changesets
   - Create a GitHub release with downloadable artifacts when the version PR is merged
